Some css that works nicely with org exports. 

* [tidy-css](https://poweredbyporridge.github.io/tidy-css/tidy-css.css)
* [Common org file header](https://poweredbyporridge.github.io/tidy-css/org.header.org). Imported using the header from:

This is a minor modification of the solarized CSS by thomasf:

Thank you thomasf!

I only added the TOC on the left and changed some heading sizes and colours. And suppressed the printed toc. Then removed that because it messed up the fonts - didn't seem to allow the narrow font to be narrow.

Latest update.  I used the TOC from orgmode.org's css:
https://orgmode.org/worg/style/worg.css

Tweaked in a minor way so that it does what I want it to do.

Thank you:
