Some css that works nicely with org exports. 

This is a minor modification of the solarized CSS by thomasf:

Thank you thomasf!

I only added the TOC on the left and changed some heading sizes and colours. And suppressed the printed toc. Then removed that because it messed up the fonts - didn't seem to allow the narrow font to be narrow.
